The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or
bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
The numbers indicate the number of mines that are in squares touching the current square. 
There must be this many mines in adjacent squares - there cannot be fewer or more mines than this.
